Raiden transport messages
#########################

Transport
=========
Messages are exchanged in JSON format using Matrix as a transport layer. Messages can be sent either via broadcast channel or via direct messaging
channel.

Rationale
---------
* plaintext JSON messages are easy to read for both humans and machines
* JSON format is widely used and can be easily validated using JSON-schema (http://json-schema.org/)
* JSON is easily extensible and extension can be made backward-compatible
* Message format must not be dependent on the transport used - it should not matter whether the message is sent via Matrix or REST
* Sender identity verification must not be part of the transport. It should be possible to submit the message over an untrusted channel or delegate.

Fields validation
-----------------
* Receiver SHOULD use JSON schema to validate integrity of received message depending on the message type.
* For messages that contain data later used as a smart contract parameters, receiver MUST check for overflows and conversion errors.
* Any values to be used on-chain MUST NOT in any circuimstances be floats.
* For ecrecover-able signatures, Sender identity SHOULD be verified.

Message format
--------------
The message MUST contain ``body`` field. This field MUST be a JSON object, and it MAY be empty.
Contents of the field are implementation dependent. Message MAY also contain other fields in the root JSON object, but the application MUST NOT depend on existence of these fields.


Simplest valid message is defined as follows

``
{ 'body': {} }
``


Example of a message
-------------------

``
{
    'body': {
        'type': 'SubmitBalanceProof',
        'network_id': 1,
        'balance_proof': {
            'signature': '0x123...abc',
            'nonce': 1
        },
        'reward_proof': {
            'signature': '0x234...def',
            'reward_amount': 100,
            'channel_id': 23
        }
    }
}
``
